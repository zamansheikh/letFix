flutterfire configure          
flutterfire: command not found

how to fix this for linux ?

This error message is indicating that the command flutterfire configure is not recognized by your system. This likely means that the flutterfire package is not installed or is not in the system's PATH.

To fix this issue, you will need to install the flutterfire package. You can do this by running the following command:

  flutter pub global activate firebase_core

If it still not working, you may need to add the directory where the package is located to your system's PATH. The location of the package will depend on your system, but it is typically located in a directory such as ~/.pub-cache/bin or ~/.flutter-sdk/bin. Once you have located the directory, you can add it to your PATH by adding the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g. .bashrc or .bash_profile):

  export PATH="$PATH:path/to/flutterfire/directory"

Make sure to replace path/to/flutterfire/directory with the actual path to the directory where the package is located.

how to find this path?

You can use the which command to find the path to the flutterfire package.

For example, you can run the following command in your terminal:

  which flutterfire

This will return the path to the flutterfire executable if it is installed and in your system's PATH.

Alternatively, you can also use the find command to search for the package in your system. For example, you can run the following command:

  find / -name flutterfire 2>/dev/null

This command will search for all files named flutterfire starting at the root directory /, and redirect error messages to /dev/null so they don't clutter the output.

If it doesn't find any file, you can check if the package is in your project directory by running

  ls -al ~/.pub-cache/bin/

This will list all the files and directories in the ~/.pub-cache/bin/ directory and you can check if flutterfire is present there.
