No, the rename 's/ /_/g' * command will only rename files in the current directory, not in any subdirectories. If you want to rename files in all subdirectories as well, you can use the -r or --recursive option with the rename command.

Here's how the command would look with the -r option:

    rename -r 's/ /_/g' *

This will recursively search for all files and directories under the current directory and rename all files with spaces replaced by underscores.

Note that the rename command with the -r option will rename all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, so make sure to double-check your files and back them up before running the command.


To rename all files in a directory on Linux and convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, you can use the rename command with the tr command. Here's how to do it:

   Open a terminal in Linux and navigate to the directory that contains the files you want to rename.

   Use the rename command to rename all files in the directory:

    rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

   This will convert all uppercase letters to lowercase letters in the filenames.

   Press Enter to execute the command. This will rename all files in the directory, converting all uppercase letters to lowercase.

Note that the rename command will rename all files in the directory, so make sure to double-check your files and back them up before running the command. Also, this command will only convert the letters in the filenames to lowercase, not any other characters.
